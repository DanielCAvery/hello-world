# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.
I'm Daniel Avery, a greenhorn when it comes to GitHub, though I've actually been programming since 2008, when I taught myself HTML and CSS to build a portfolio website for my film school demos to find my first job (and the plan worked!).

My coding history is as follows:
HTML - 2008 - self teaching
CSS - 2008 - from the book "CSS: The Missing Manual"
HTML & CSS brush up - 2013 - through an Information Systems class at BYU's Marriott School of Management
Java - 2013 - through an Information Systems class at BYU's Marriott School of Management
VBA (inside Microsoft Excel) - 2013 - through an Information Systems class at BYU's Marriott School of Management
SASS/SCSS - 2015 - through Treehouse.com
JavaScript - 2016 - through a bootcamp on Udemy.com
jQuery - 2016 - through a bootcamp on Udemy.com
C# - 2017 - through a computer science class at Utah Valley University
